Introduction 
 
I was given a project to make a shooter game in 2D using Unity. Unity is a cross platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies back 2005. Unity give the user the ability to create games and experiences in both 2D and 3D. has extended to support more then 20 platforms. This shooter game can either be designed in classic, top-down, vertical or horizontal scroller format. I will need to Research theses different formats before finally deciding the game design I want to make and design. 

In this Report there is a lot of research done and research of history of different games. I will tell you Research that I have conducted and tell you why I choose the game format I wanted to make. It wasn’t that to search for information on certain topics as everything is on the internet and within fingertips of anyone. Also, I when go through the game chooses and walkthrough of each level that I designed and how I designed it too. 

The name of my game will be called BossMan and the bosses nickname will be Blimey.   

Walkthrough  

The game is pretty much the same as the design document that I handed up with a few altercations, with improvements and downgrades. Overall, I wanted the game to have a realistic feeling to it and I hope I made it feel that way to it.  
 
Menu  
Same as I described in the design document. Only one altercation was I added volume instead of settings. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tutorial  

The user gets the opportunity to use the controls and practice them. Controls and enemy are the same. I have added the second enemy to fire a star bullet in the direction path of player. I have added a gun to use in the game. The player starts with no gun but is given a gun straight away. Also there is a button at bottom right to return to 
main menu. 
  
How to Play  

In here the user will be presented with a window that will give instructions in how to move the player and shoot the enemies. It goes through the controls in detail. In the below heading it describes the controls in detail and tell the user how move the player throughout the game. 
  
Settings  

In this page, a few down grades with only one scroll bar to increase and decrease the volume. Couldn’t assign the difficulty of the level.  
   
Level 1  

From the start of the level the user will enter the game, and in front of the player will be a gun(pistol). The pistol has a certain type of fire rate and force. Some enemies fire bullets and the exit are connected to the second level. Also, I have added pick up items once the player moves over the item unless their health is 100. 
  
Level 2  

Like level 1 but with more enemies and the level gets harder as the player moves along. There are 2 guns for the user to pick up and the second gun has a better force and fire rate built into it. Also, there are 2 health pickups in case the player loses health. Some enemies fire bullets also.  
  
Boss Level 

Same as I described in design document. Few improvements I made is in relation to pickups and the boss. The bosses star bullets and increase speed. The health pickup has increased the boss is tricky to beat.
